# üßÆ Twitter LBO Financial Model (2022 Buyout Case Study)

This project is a full Leveraged Buyout (LBO) financial model of Twitter, built in Microsoft Excel, simulating Elon Musk's acquisition of the company in 2022. It aims to replicate and analyze the core financial engineering involved in large-scale private equity transactions using realistic capital structures and exit scenarios.

## üìå Project Objective

The goal of this model is to:
- Replicate the financing structure used in the actual Twitter acquisition deal
- Understand how private equity firms structure buyouts using various debt instruments
- Forecast cash flows, build a debt schedule, and calculate investor returns (IRR, MOIC)
- Check outcomes using different operating and exit assumptions

## üß± Model Structure

The Excel model includes the following sheets:

| Sheet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Assumptions` | Key deal terms, revenue/EBITDA growth, entry/exit multiples, interest rates |
| `IS` | Pro forma Income Statement over the holding period |
| `BS` | Balance Sheet projections including debt & equity changes |
| `Cash Flow` | Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and cash sweeps |
| `Debt Schedule` | Breakdown of different debt tranches, interest, repayments, and amortization |
| `Returns` | Equity IRR and MOIC calculation for financial sponsors |

## üß† Key Concepts Applied

- **LBO Mechanics**: Entry valuation, leverage ratios, debt tranches, and exit proceeds  
- **Debt Structuring**:
  - Senior secured term loans
  - Revolving credit facility
  - Bridge loans with bullet maturity
- **Floating Interest Rates**: Modeled using SOFR-based spreads  
- **Investor Returns**: Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC)  
- **Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis**: Evaluating impact of macro and business assumptions on exit returns

## üìä Model Outputs

- Pro forma financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)
- Investor return metrics (IRR, MOIC)
- Capital structure evolution over the holding period
- Paydown schedule of each debt tranches

## üíº Deal Context

In 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter in a highly publicized $44B deal. This model mirrors the financing structure used, based on publicly available information about the deal, including:
- ~$13B in debt financing from major investment banks
- ~$33B in equity, including Musk‚Äôs own capital
- Use of bridge loans and intention to refinance via high-yield bonds

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
- Advanced Excel modeling techniques (data tables, circular references, iterative calculations)  
- Corporate finance principles  
- Capital markets & leveraged finance knowledge
